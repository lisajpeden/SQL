# Lisa Peden's SQL Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi! I'm Lisa, and welcome to my SQL Data Analyst Portfolio.

This code repository contains smaples of SQL I've written. I started this portfolio to compliment my work towards becoming a Data Analyst. I look forward to watching my SQL skills grow and cannot wait for what the future holds as far as career opportunities.

SQL is the first step into the data world.. and I am absolutley hooked.

Feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions :)

Thanks,

Lisa
